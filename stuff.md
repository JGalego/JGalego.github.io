## (Supposedly) Fun Things

* [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) teaches how to build a modern computer from first principles - it has spawned all kinds of insane projects including a [16-bit ALU implementation in Minecraft](https://hackaday.com/2010/09/29/16-bit-alu-in-minecraft/) ‚õèüß±
* The new edition of [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.codehiddenlanguage.com/) by Charles Petzold is an absolute treasure - it covers everything from playing with flashlights üî¶ with your best friend to the *"worldwide hum of the internet"* üåê
* Erik Demaine's [lectures on data structures, algorithms and programming](https://erikdemaine.org/classes/) are mind-blowing - be sure to watch the lectures on [models of computation and document distance](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/resources/lecture-2-models-of-computation-document-distance/) (I guarantee you'll never look at your Python scripts the same way again) and [temporal data structures](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring21/lectures/L01.html) (expect time travel analogies üïìüöÄ and movie references)
* Kevin Zurawel's [Game Development in 8bits or... stupid NES tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPbroUDHG0s) is a lesson on creative limitation

* [MinutePhysics](https://www.youtube.com/c/minutephysics) uses whiteboard animation to explain all kinds of physics-related topics - the video on [boat wakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95sQcSulRFM) is a personal favourite
* Anything by [3Blue1Brow](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)... [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbu7Zu5X1zI)'s how he does the animations using [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)
* If brown paper math derivations tickle your fancy, check out [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Numberphile)

## (Actually) Fun Things

## Meta Stuff

* Few things are as meta as Douglas Hofstadter's [GEB](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567), an exploration of self-reference and recursivity featuring a wide ensemble of Carrollian-like characters
* A recent (meta-)piece for *The Atlantic* on why [`meta` doesn't mean what you thing it does](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/meta-origin-irony/661191/)
