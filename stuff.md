## (Supposedly) Fun Things

* [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) teaches how to build a modern computer from first principles - it has spawned all kinds of insane projects including a [16-bit ALU implementation in Minecraft](https://hackaday.com/2010/09/29/16-bit-alu-in-minecraft/) ‚õèüß±
* Erik Demaine's [lectures on data structures, algorithms and programming](https://erikdemaine.org/classes/) are absolute gems - be sure to watch the lectures on [models of computation and document distance](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/resources/lecture-2-models-of-computation-document-distance/) (you'll never look at Python the same way) and [temporal data structures](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring21/lectures/L01.html) (think time travel üïìüöÄ)
* Kevin Zurawel's [Game Development in 8bits or... stupid NES tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPbroUDHG0s) is a lesson on creative limitation... and a (not so) hidden treasure
* [MinutePhysics](https://www.youtube.com/c/minutephysics) uses whiteboard animation to explain all kinds of physics-related topics - the video on [boat wakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95sQcSulRFM) is a personal favourite
* If brown paper derivations tickle your fancy, check out [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/Numberphile)

## (Actually) Fun Things

* [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) - a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language
* [smbc](https://smbc-comics.com) - a webcomic that covers science, research, superheroes, religion, romance, dating, parenting and the meaning of life (uff!)
* [IP over Avian Carriers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1149) - an IETF RFC for... well, the name says it all üê¶; contains sentences like *"because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, loss of a carrier can be tolerated"*

## Meta Stuff

* If you get off on things like `_='_=%r;print(_%%_)';print(_%_)`, then you'll absolutely love [Quine Relay](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay)
* There's an [awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) of awesome lists of awesome things - smells like [Russell's paradox](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/) to me!
* Few things are as meta as Douglas Hofstadter's [GEB](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567), an exploration of self-reference and recursivity featuring all types of Carrollian-like characters
* Finally, a recent piece for *The Atlantic* on why [`meta` doesn't mean what you thing it does](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/meta-origin-irony/661191/)
