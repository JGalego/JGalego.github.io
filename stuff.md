## Useful Links

For AI practitioners 🧠

* Here's a curated list of essential papers that every AI practitioner should read (though most won't):
    - [A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2347736.2347755) by Domingos
    - [Machine Learning that Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4656) by Wagstaff
    - [Tidy Data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) by Wickham
    - [Hidden Technical Debt](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/hash/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Abstract.html) (yes, that one!) by Sculley & Co.
* [Awesome Safety-Critical AI](https://awesome.critical-ai.dev) is a curated collection of resources on AI applications in high-stakes domains
* Some of my older articles on [AWS Community](https://community.aws/@jgalego)

## (Supposedly) Fun Things

* [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) teaches you how to build a modern computer from first principles - it has spawned all kinds of incredible projects, including a [16-bit ALU implementation in Minecraft](https://hackaday.com/2010/09/29/16-bit-alu-in-minecraft/) ⛏🧱
* The new edition of [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.codehiddenlanguage.com/) by Charles Petzold is an absolute treasure - it covers everything from playing with flashlights 🔦 with your best friend to the *"worldwide hum of the internet"* 🌐
