## poolside Offsite in Peniche 🥽

<!-- excerpt-start -->

Still buzzing from an incredible exchange with the leadership team poolside where we explored a (not-so-distant) future where humans and AI agents work side by side.

🏒 We both understand how critical it is to "skate to where the puck is going, not where it is today": AI innovation is a red queen's race that demands anticipation, quick adaptation, and a solid sense of direction.

🙏 I'm very grateful for the insights, the energy, and the shared ambition to build what’s next

👏 Kudos Jason Warner, Eiso Kant, Margarida Garcia, José Caldeira, Vítor Monteiro, Varun Randery and Paul St John for pushing the 'arc of the possible' to its limits!
