## Dependable AI in Airborne Systems ✈️

<!-- excerpt-start -->

Integrating AI into safety-critical embedded systems in aeronautics presents unique challenges. This talk will address the complexities of ensuring reliability, predictability, and compliance with stringent safety standards.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

I'll be talking about Critical Software's role in the Safe ONNX and WG-114 / SAEG34 (AI in Aviation) working groups, highlighting our efforts to standardize and certify AI models for safe deployment in aviation.

Attendees will gain insights on how to overcome the hurdles of AI integration in high-stakes domains.
