In this 10-minute video, we cover everything from how to improve cost awareness with [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/), [AWS Budgets and Budget Actions](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/), and the [Cloud Intelligence Dashboards (CUDOS Framework)](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cudos-framework-deployment), to short-, medium- and long-term recommendations for cost optimization.
