## AI x Innovation @ AIHub 🧠

<!-- excerpt-start -->

Today, the AI x Innovation team went on a 'school trip' to the AIHub by Unicorn Factory Lisboa to talk with startups working on the bleeding edge of AI. 

😊 We had a very special visit by mayor Carlos Moedas who graciously agreed to take a picture with us.

📩 Feel free to send your resumé to Critical Software, Mr. Mayor... once an engineer, always an engineer, and we have plenty of roles to fill.

🙏 Special thanks to Mariana Montenegro and the rest of the AIHub team for hosting us
