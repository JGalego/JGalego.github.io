My take on the GenAI narrative. *No hype, no hubris, no hogwash*.

A while ago, I had this crazy idea of building an interactive presentation to introduce generative AI (GenAI for short) to a wider audience.

I've been using and testing [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for quite some time now with different audiences and the feedback has been great, so I figured I'd create some cool slides, chain them together in a nice way, sprinkle some references and easter eggs, then find a quick method to host them on [GitHub Pages](https://danielabaron.me/blog/build-and-publish-presentation-with-html-and-css/). [ðŸ‘‰ Here](https://jgalego.github.io/GenAI) is the result.

You can read it as the story of what came 'before', as in before GenAI became the big, explosive 'thing' it is today, what we have now (warts and all) and how we can use it to build incredible stuff, and what is coming (tbh this part still needs some work).

The presentation requires some background knowledge and it doesn't shy away from the technical details, but I tried my best to keep the math and jargon to a minimum. The emphasis is on the narrative.

This may seem paradoxical, but it's not. Hopefully, the slides will serve as proof.

Feel free to explore and just DM me if you find any bugs!
