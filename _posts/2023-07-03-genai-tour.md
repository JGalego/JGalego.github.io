## A Tour of GenAI ðŸš€ - There and Back Again

<!-- excerpt-start -->

My take on the GenAI narrative. *No hype, no hubris, no hogwash*.

**Update:** Now available at [jgalego.github.io/GenAI](https://jgalego.github.io/GenAI)

A while ago, I had this not-so-crazy idea of building an interactive presentation to introduce GenAI to a wider audience.

I've been testing [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for quite some time now with different audiences and the feedback has been great, so I figured I'd create some cool slides, chain them together in a nice way, sprinkle some references, then find a quick method to host them on [GitHub Pages](https://danielabaron.me/blog/build-and-publish-presentation-with-html-and-css/). 

[This](https://jgalego.github.io/GenAI) is the result.

You can read it as the story of what came before, what we have now (warts and all) and what is coming (tbh this part needs some work).

The presentation requires some background knowledge and it doesn't shy away from the technical details, but I tried my best to keep the math and jargon to a minimum. This may seem paradoxical, but it's not. Hopefully, the slides will be living proof of that.

Feel free to explore and just DM me if you find any bugs!
