> 💬 “Language was just difference. A thousand different ways of seeing, of moving through the world. No; a thousand worlds within one. And translation – a necessary endeavour, however futile, to move between them.” <br><br>― R. F. Kuang, [Babel, or the Necessity of Violence: An Arcane History of the Oxford Translators' Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Babel-Necessity-Violence-Translators-Revolution/dp/0063021420)
