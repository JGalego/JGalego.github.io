In collaboration with the [AIHub by Unicorn Factory Lisboa](https://unicornfactorylisboa.com/), weâ€™re organizing a semi-private red teaming exercise focused on AI that will take place in our Lisbon office. This will be a unique event that brings together enterprises and some of the most promising startups in the field to test the limits of AI systems in a controlled, ethical, and collaborative environment.
