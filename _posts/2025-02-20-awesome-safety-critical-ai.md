## Safety-Critical AI is now Awesome ðŸš€

<!-- excerpt-start -->

[Awesome Safety-Critical AI](https://awesome.critical-ai.dev) contains a curated list of references on the role of AI in safety-critical systems i.e. systems whose failure can result in loss of life, significant property damage or harm to the environment.

AI in critical systems is not about polishing demos or chasing benchmarks. Itâ€™s about anticipating chaos - and designing for it.

This isnâ€™t just another (awesome) list. Itâ€™s a call to action!
