## Safety-Critical AI is now Awesome ðŸš€

<!-- excerpt-start -->

Started something yesterday, hopefully it will take off (pun intended).

[Awesome Safety-Critical AI](https://jgalego.github.io/awesome-safety-critical-ai/) contains a curated list of references on the role of AI in safety-critical systems i.e. systems whose failure can result in loss of life, significant property damage or damage to the environment.

You'll find references on safe and responsible AI, reliable ML, AI testing, V&V in AI, real-world case studies, and much, much more.

ðŸŒŸ Let me know what you think and don't forget to [star it](https://github.com/JGalego/awesome-safety-critical-ai)!
