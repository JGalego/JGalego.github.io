<p>A (not so deep) exploration of <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index">🤗 Transformers</a> training on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/">AWS Trainium</a>.</p>

<p>Inspired by Julien Simon’s post on how to <a href="https://julsimon.medium.com/accelerate-transformer-training-with-aws-trainium-d20cd3f9dc08">Accelerate Transformer training with AWS Trainium</a> 🙌, I’ve created a small project with a some Terraform configurations and PyTorch training scripts to help you get started ASAP.</p>

<p>The goal is to show how little one has to change (code-wise) to run training jobs on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Trn1</code> instances, starting from Hugging Face’s demo on <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training">how to fine-tune a pretrained model</a>.</p>

<p>It is still a WIP 🚧 so feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions on how to improve it.</p>

<p>The ubiquity of algorithms and data is one of the hallmarks of the <span title="According to Merriam-Webster, 'the modern age regarded as a time in which information has become a commodity that is quickly and widely disseminated and easily available especially through the use of computer technology'">Information Age</span>. In a world powered by technology, where smartphones have more computing power than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRZz0SVLdso">all of NASA’s computers during the Apollo missions</a>, algorithms run virtually everything.</p>

<p>However, in the advent of the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2018/12/what-is-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-4IR.html">4th Industrial Revolution</a>, data is growing faster than it can be analyzed and classic algorithms have been unable to cope with this <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/">Big Data explosion</a>. This is where Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) in particular, really shine.</p>

<p>ML systems learn directly from data without being <em>explicitly</em> told to do so, and they have found enormous success in such tasks as email filtering, computer-aided diagnostics (CADx) and autonomous driving. Companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google are investing heavily on AI, and ML engineer and data scientist positions are among the highest paid and “sexiest” jobs of the early 21st century. Nonetheless, getting past the hype and putting buzzwords aside is hard when one lacks a basic understanding of how these systems actually work.
